# Game Engine and 2D Platformer

## The Game engine 

### Add an object

To add an object : click on the button of the object you want to add and then click on the scene where you want to add it.
You cannot place the object in an other place than the scene.

### Set up the object & Move the object in the scene

To set up the object : click on its name in the hierarchy panel to select it.
(Everything that is clickable is **white**.)
A green border will appear around the object to show that it is selected.

In the scene : you can drag the item (only when selected) to change its position.
you can also rezise it by dragging the little squares on the border of the object.

**Be careful !!!!!** You have to be really slow to move the object or its position will be reset to the center.
So dont put a too big object in the scene or it will be completly mess up and you will have to delete the object.

You can delete an item by pressing the `delete` key on your keyboard when its selected.

In the inspector : you can change the name of the object, its position, its rotation and many other things.
Click on the element to change it (the white text).

You can use the Assets that I have put in the Folder Assets to test the sound or the textures.

### Play the game

Once the scene is set up, you can play the game by clicking on the play button (upper right in white).
The controls are : 
- Arrows to move
- Arrow up to jump
- Shift to dash

To finish the game you must have all the cookies in your inventory.
If you fall into the void you'll die by the way.
Otherwise the finish object will not end the game. (if there are no finish you cant end the game)
